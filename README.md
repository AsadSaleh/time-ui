# Welcome to Timezone-UI

This project was created by As'ad and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run the app locally, you'll need to:

1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

The app will run in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To run the test:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## To build and serve the production ready app, you'll need to:

1. run `npm run build`
2. run `npm install -g serve`
3. run `serve -s build`

It will builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 3000.
